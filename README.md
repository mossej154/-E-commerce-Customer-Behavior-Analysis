# E-commerce Customer Behavior Analysis & Strategy

## Project Overview

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a simulated E-commerce transaction dataset (22,049 records) to identify core customer demographics, purchasing habits, and revenue drivers.

The goal was to transition raw data into actionable business intelligence by uncovering key trends related to product category performance, discount effectiveness by device, and customer loyalty. The resulting analysis lays the foundation for strategic decisions in marketing, inventory management, and platform optimization.

## Key Findings & Actionable Insights

### 1. Revenue Drivers

Electronics Dominance: The Electronics category is the undisputed revenue leader, generating approximately 2.5 times the sales of the next closest category (Home & Garden).

Action: Prioritize inventory, strategic partnerships, and promotional focus around Electronics and associated cross-selling opportunities.

### 2. Discount Strategy

Mobile-First Promotions: The discount budget is heavily skewed toward mobile users, who received 1.6 times the total discount amount compared to desktop users.

Action: Continue refining the mobile strategy; ensure the mobile app/site experience is flawless to capitalize on this incentivized traffic.

### 3. Customer Loyalty & Engagement

High Retention Rate: A significant 70% of all transactions were placed by returning customers, suggesting strong product-market fit and a successful retention loop.

Payment Preference: Credit Card and Digital Wallet are the two most popular payment methods. Cash on Delivery is negligible.

Action: Focus on optimizing the checkout flow for Credit Card and Digital Wallet users to minimize friction and cart abandonment.
